# Retro: #881 — pi-permission-system: a path-surface ask's review entries and dialog carry no blame

## Stage: Planning (2026-10-16T15:20:30Z)

### Session summary

Planned four steps: a `refactor:` that adds `decidingPath: { path, effect, effectSource } | null` to `PromptRequestFacts` and lets the tolerant reader admit it; a `fix:` that has the two bash gates stamp it through `path-ask-payload.ts` and has `renderReviewLogFacts` render flat `decidingPath`/`effect`/`effectSource` keys; a `fix:` that adds a `why` core line to the dialog; and a `docs:` step.
The issue is the "declared-effects" batch tail, so `/ship` releases [#880] together with it.
The operator settled two design questions at the gate, and I posted a comment on [#952] at the operator's request.

### Observations

- Re-measured against the local review log: 331 bash `external_directory` `waiting` entries since 2026-09-05, none recording a path, and no entry in the whole log carrying an `effect` key.
  Since directional surfaces arrived (2026-08-27), 202 of 419 bash `external_directory` asks (48%) landed on the bare family, which is where the teaching sentence fires.
- The issue's example teaching sentence (`declare git log in commandEffects`) assumed the deciding path knows its command, and it doesn't.
  `PathToken` has no command field, and the resolver merges tokens from different commands into one path.
  The operator chose the generic sentence; naming the producing word is [#1062]'s mechanism.
- Tool path asks carry `decidingPath: null` (operator decision).
  The operator asked whether Pi 1.2.0's `reachesTools` mattered here.
  I traced it: it names the *tools* a `codemode`/`tool_search` call can reach, says nothing about filesystem direction, and nested calls are already gated one by one.
  The adjacent `ToolAnnotations.readOnlyHint` (since Pi 0.99.0) is the only SDK signal of a tool's direction.
  It is the tool's own self-description, so treating it as proof would be self-granted relief; I recorded it on [#952] as a design input.
  I first misidentified the operator's "Pi 1.3.0 tool" reference as `ToolCall.argumentsError`; the operator corrected it to 1.2.0's `reachesTools`.
- The review-log key is `decidingPath`, not `path`, because `PermissionPrompter` writes `path: details.path ?? null` after spreading the payload facts, which would overwrite it.
  Flat `effect`/`effectSource` keep the runner-written entries' existing key names.
- The Tidy-First assessor (sonnet-5-5) recommended no preparatory commit.
  It caught three things:
  - The design passed a `TokenEffect` where `DecidingPath` expected a flat `effect`.
    The plan now flattens once, in a `decidingPathFact` helper in `path-ask-payload.ts`, which also makes the roadmap's `effectSource` metric read 1.
  - `buildExternalDirectoryAskPayload` has only tool callers, so it gains no new input.
  - A `tool.ts` doc comment credits the `logContext` routing this change removes.
- Accepted risk: when two attributions of one path disagree (`cat a > a`), the fold gives `{unproven, unproven}`, so the dialog suggests a declaration that wouldn't change that outcome.
- No follow-up issues were filed.
  The `codemode`/`tool_search` exposure check was offered and not requested.

#### Deferred tidyings

- `src/presentation/prompt-payload.ts`: the local enum lists (`BASH_COMMAND_CONTEXTS`, and now the effect lists) use `satisfies readonly T[]`, which does not check exhaustiveness; exporting the value lists from `access-intent/effect.ts` was rated optional and skipped.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-10-16T15:52:43Z)

### Session summary

I landed all four planned steps: `refactor(pi-permission-system): carry a deciding path as a prompt request fact`, the two `fix:` commits (review-log blame, then the dialog's `why` line), and the docs commit.
The first review returned WARN, so I added a `test:` commit and a `docs:` commit (`cross-extension-api.md`).
The `pi-permission-system` suite went from 6316 to 6344 tests (+28).

### Observations

- **Plan deviation (wording).**
  A retraction's clause reads "an option withdrew the claim", not "the read claim".
  A `commandEffects` guard can withdraw a declared write or `[]`, not only the core's read.
  The `fix:` commit body records this.
- **Plan deviation (placement).**
  The `why` line sits right after the value line in `coreFacts`, so it reads under the path or command it explains.
- **Plan deviation (metric).**
  The health-metric table has only a fixed baseline and a target column, so the delivered `effectSource` count (1) went into the roadmap step's `Landed:` note rather than the table.
- **Mutation finding.**
  The plan predicted that making the reader return `decidingPath: null` would also kill `permission-ui-prompt.test.ts`'s verbatim-core test.
  It does not: `buildUiPrompt` passes `request` through without the reader.
  That test pins the bus pass-through, not the reader.
- **Pins.**
  Every killing mutation the plan named turned its tests red.
  Three extra mutations also turned red:
  - the reader's path-type check;
  - giving the tool `path.ts` gate a deciding effect;
  - dropping `renderReviewLogFacts` from the runner's shared `logContext`, plus a variant affecting only the session arm.
- **Process slip.**
  I batched a mutation `Edit` with the vitest run and the `cp` of the green file, so the green copy may have captured the mutation.
  `runner.ts` had no uncommitted edits, so I restored it from HEAD and re-ran the mutation on its own.
  Earlier, a hand-written mutation for the dialog's evidence arm came out as unparsable code, and I restored it from the green copy before reading any result.
- **Edit friction.**
  An `Edit` whose `oldText` spans `§` or `—` failed twice while I was removing the gates' log-context comment.
  A line-anchored Python script did the removal, as the `edit-tool` skill recommends.
- **Pre-completion reviewer: WARN, then PASS on the delta.**
  The round 1 WARNs were:
  - `cross-extension-api.md` omitted `decidingPath` (fixed);
  - the runner's session and yolo arms were unpinned (fixed with an `it.each` over all three arms);
  - the "not breaking" classification holds for readers of `PromptRequestFacts` but is a compile-time break for code that constructs one.
- **Reviewer warning carried to `/ship`.**
  `pi-permission-model-judge`'s test fixture (`test/fixtures/permission-details.ts`) builds a `PromptPayload` literal against its pinned `27.0.0` devDependency.
  It already lacks `matchedSpelling` and will also need `decidingPath` when that pin bumps.
  Adding either field now would be an excess-property error against `27.0.0`, so I left it.
  At ship time, decide whether to file a follow-up issue or leave it to the bump.
  The reviewer also noted that the `matchedSpelling` precedent first shipped inside a major release (`40.0.0`), so it shows the commit type was acceptable, not that the release was a minor.
